This Excel VBA project comprises four tabs: "Final," "Jan," "Feb," "March," and "April." Each monthly tab ('Jan,' 'Feb,' 'March,' 'April') contains employee information organized in a single column, encompassing details such as name, company, business address, city, office phone, and website.

The first macro, Macro 1, is designed to generate a tabular representation of this data when executed on each monthly tab. It structures the information into a table format adjacent to the existing data, improving readability and accessibility.

Macro 2 is responsible for amalgamating all the tabular data produced by Macro 1 from each monthly tab onto the "Final" tab. This consolidation simplifies data analysis and enables a comprehensive overview of all employee information across the different months.

The project streamlines the organization of employee details and facilitates a unified presentation of this data, enhancing efficiency in data management and analysis within Excel.
